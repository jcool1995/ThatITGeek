 Here's how to get started:

### Repository Structure

- Everyone will create their own folder in the root directory of this repository.
- Your folder will be your personal workspace to store and share your projects.

### Getting Started

1. **Create Your Personal Folder**
   - Create a folder with your name or username
   - Example: `mkdir john_doe`
   - Change into your folder: `cd john_doe`

2. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

3. **Working on Projects**
   - All your work should be committed and pushed to your personal folder
   - Commit and push your changes frequently

4. **Committing Your Work**
   ```bash
   # Inside your personal folder
   git add .
   git commit -m "Descriptive commit message about your work"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Best Practices

- Keep your code clean and well-documented
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Organize your projects logically within your personal folder
- Feel free to create subfolders for different projects
